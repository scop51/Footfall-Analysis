ATM and Mall-Based Footfall Analysis

Overview

This project focuses on analyzing footfall trends at ATMs and malls using data-driven techniques. The goal is to understand customer movement patterns, peak hours, and external factors influencing foot traffic. The insights from this analysis can be used to optimize resource allocation, improve customer experience, and enhance security measures.

Features

Footfall Data Collection: Aggregates data from various sources, such as surveillance cameras, sensors, and transaction logs.

Trend Analysis: Identifies peak hours, seasonal variations, and abnormal patterns.

Predictive Modeling: Uses machine learning techniques to forecast footfall trends.

Visualization: Interactive charts and heatmaps for better data interpretation.

Anomaly Detection: Detects unusual activity for security and business insights.

Technologies Used

Python for data processing and analysis

Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization

Scikit-learn for machine learning models

TensorFlow/PyTorch for deep learning applications
